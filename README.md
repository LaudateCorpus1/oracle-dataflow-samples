# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow Samples


This repository provides examples demonstrating how to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow.

## Setup
* [Quick start](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-flow/using/dfs_getting_started.htm)


## How To
| Description                                          | Python |
|------------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| CSV to Parquet                                       |[sample](./python/csv_to_parquet)|

For step-by-step instructions, see the README.txt files included with
each sample.

## Running the Samples:
These samples show how to use the OCI Data Flow service and are meant
to be deployed to and run from Oracle Cloud. You can optionally test
these applications locally before you deploy them. To test these
applications locally, Apache Spark needs to be installed.

## Install Spark
To install Spark, visit [spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/index.html)
and pick the installation path that best suits your environment.
