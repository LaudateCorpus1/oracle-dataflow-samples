# Reporting security vulnerabilities

Oracle values the independent security research community and believes that
responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security
and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to
<mailto:secalert_us@oracle.com> preferably with a proof of concept. Please review
some additional information on [how to report security vulnerabilities to Oracle][1].
We encourage people who contact Oracle Security to use email encryption using
[our encryption key][2].

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact the project maintainers
directly.

Non-vulnerability related security issues including ideas for new or improved
security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

## Security updates, alerts and bulletins

The Oracle Cloud operations and security teams regularly evaluate Oracleâ€™s Critical
Patch Updates and Security Alert fixes as well as relevant third-party fixes as they
become available and apply the relevant patches in accordance with applicable
change management processes. Customers requiring additional information that is not
addressed in the Critical Patch Update Advisory may obtain additional information
should submit a SR within their designated support system

## Security-related information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations
for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note
that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be
sufficiently hardened for production use.
